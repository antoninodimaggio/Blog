Hello my name is Antonino DiMaggio, I am a recent computer science graduate of  <a href="http://csrankings.org/#/index?ai&vision&mlmining&nlp&ir" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rutgers University</a> with a strong background in mathematics, science, and programming. In my spare time I like to solve problems in renewable energy using data science and machine learning.
