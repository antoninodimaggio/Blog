---

People love to argue about statements that are either blatantly true or blatantly false. It seems idotic that people would, for example, argue on Twitter for hours on end over a statement that is completely false. These arguments, however, are not idiotic. They are a result of human nature.

Paul Graham says “The statements that make people mad are the ones they worry might be believed” — this also applies to statements that people worry might not be believed. This conclusion was true when the church ostracized Galileo for stating that the earth revolved around the sun and is still true when browsing through the replies to Donald Trump’s Tweets. I do not mean to pick on Trump, but the man is my go to example when it comes to exploring social phenomenon.

For the sake of brevity, I am going to make a long story short. During the 2020 United States presidential election, Trump decided to write a couple of vague, premature [Tweets](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1325099845045071873) stating that he had won. When you distance yourself from the situation it is clear that Trump still had the potential to win the election at the time of his Tweets. I hope it is obvious that potentially winning and actually winning are not the same, therefore his Tweets were false. [[1]]({{< relref "blatant-statements.md#1" >}})

The majority of Trump and Biden supporters knew that Trump's statements were false, or at the very least premature;  however, this is not what drove the response in the replies. Trump supporters flocked to the replies thinking that Biden supporters would not believe Trump's claims of victory. Biden supporters flocked to the replies to make sure that Trump supporters did not believe that the election was over. What drove the response was each side's assumptions about what the other side might believe, not the validity of the statement. Both sides were in perpetual check, a process that often manifests into anger.

The more rage and discourse that a statement induces, the more likely that a statement is either blatantly true or blatantly false.


<u>Notes</u>

<span id="1">[1]</span> Some statements are not easy to evaluate. When statements are vague or open ended, it is often impossible to deduce whether the statement is true or false. For example, “there should be universal health care” can not be directly evaluated to be true or false. However, this does not change the response that a statement will receive. People will evaluate the statement as true or false regardless.
