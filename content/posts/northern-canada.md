Climate change is warming northern Canada fast. On one hand, a warmer north entails the destruction of inuit traditions, sea level rise, and the disappearance of unique ecosystems. On the other hand, climate change presents a huge economic opportunity for an area that has traditionally lacked both government and private investment. [Higher latitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_amplification) are warming disproportionately fast compared to the rest of the world; widespread adoption of renewable energy and electric vehicles are not going to stop this. Climate change has upsides and downsides — the downsides are well documented while the upsides are not. For northern Canada, the upsides I am interested in are the potential for commercial agriculture and an ice free northwest passage.

There are three things that are essential for commercial agriculture to be cost competitive globally: favorable climate, arable land, and appropriate infrastructure. Let’s take soybeans as an example. Right now soybeans are [mainly grown](https://www.grainscanada.gc.ca/en/grain-research/export-quality/oilseeds/soybean-oil/2018/index.html) in the “southern” portion of Canada. With each passing year climate change is inducing longer, warmer summers at higher latitudes. This means soybeans will eventually be able to thrive farther north. There are pockets of land in northern Canada that have the appropriate water, soil, and terrain to accommodate soybean production. Right now this land is cheap because it simply has no use. In the coming decades, the climate in northern Canada will be [extremely favorable](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0228305) for the production of a wide variety of field crops, which will inevitably result in a land grab.

The land you want to grab has to have access to the appropriate infrastructure: without a suitable combination of railways, waterways, roads, and ports there is no commercial agriculture. The Canadian government needs to proactively invest in the development of infrastructure in the quickly thawing north, especially infrastructure that has the ability to take advantage of an ice free northwest passage. The northwest passage as a viable shipping lane will slash thousands of miles off the journey of goods moving in and out of Asia. Currently, to the best of my knowledge, the [Port of Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Churchill) is the only serious deep water port on the Hudson Bay. As of now the northwest passage is not a viable commercial shipping lane, but could very well be the single most influential side effect of climate change.

Canada already has ports to reach both Asia and Europe. The issue is getting to these ports in the first place. The area around the St. Lawrence Seaway is well developed. However, as you move inland and farther north, it becomes clear that the [limiting constraint](http://www.ggc-pgc.ca/policy/key-issues/transportation/) is indeed supporting infrastructure. The Yukon and Nunavut have [no railways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Railroads-Canada-frame.png). The Northwest Territories only railway terminates in Hay River. In the provinces where there are railways, the journey from field to port can take [thousands of miles](http://grainmonitor.ca/Downloads/SupplementalReports/GSC%20Technical%20-%20Marketing%20and%20Moving.pdf). Essentially, railways and viable waterways with accompanying infrastructure are lacking in the far north. Infrastructure is a hard problem that typically gets resolved once both private corporations and government bodies realize that there is money to be made.


There are a couple of areas in northern Canada, representing an extremely small portion of the total land mass, that I am confident will have the right ingredients to support commercial agriculture. However, I am not here to pervade my speculations. Overall, climate change presents a huge economic opportunity for northern Canada and the arctic region in general.

<u>Updates</u>

[6/9/2021] - I corrected short sightedness on the ways in which grain/crops can be transported. Also made some minor changes to wording.
