Climate change is warming northern Canada fast. On one hand, a warmer north entails the destruction of inuit traditions, sea level rise, and the disappearance of unique ecosystems. On the other hand, climate change presents a huge economic opportunity for an area that has traditionally lacked both government and private investment. No matter the global climate model, it is quite apparent that higher altitudes are warming disproportionately fast compared to the rest of the world. Widespread adoption of renewable energy and electric vehicles are not going to stop this. The damage has been done and we can only work towards preventing further damage in the future. Climate change has upsides and downsides — the downsides are well documented while the upsides are not. For northern Canada, the upsides I am interested in are the potential for commercial agriculture and an ice free northwest passage.

There are four things that are essential for commercial agriculture to flourish: favorable climate, arable land, railways, and ports. Let’s take soybeans as an example. Right now soybeans are [mainly grown](https://www.grainscanada.gc.ca/en/grain-research/export-quality/oilseeds/soybean-oil/2018/index.html) in the “southern” portion of Canada. This makes sense when you consider that northern Canada is frozen the majority of the year. However, climate change is quickly thawing out the frozen north. Longer, warmer summers means that soybeans can thrive. There are pockets of land in northern Canada that have the appropriate water, soil, and terrain to accommodate soybean production. Right now this land is cheap because it simply has no use. In the coming decades, the climate in northern Canada will be [extremely favorable](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0228305) for the production of a wide variety of field crops, which will inevitably result in a land grab.

The land you want to grab has to have access to the appropriate infrastructure. Without railways and ports there is no commercial agriculture. Climate change presents an opportunity for the Canadian Government to develop supporting infrastructure to take advantage of an ice free northwest passage. The northwest passage as a viable shipping lane will slash thousands of miles off the journey of goods moving in and out of Asia. Currently, to the best of my knowledge, there is only one transportation route for crops to get to the northwest passage. That route is through Manitoba up to the [Port of Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Churchill). As of now, the northwest passage is not a viable commercial shipping lane, but could very well be the single most influential side effect of climate change. Canada already has ports to reach both Asia and Europe. The issue is getting to these ports in the first place. Depending on the province, the journey from field to port can take [thousands of miles]((http://grainmonitor.ca/Downloads/SupplementalReports/GSC%20Technical%20-%20Marketing%20and%20Moving.pdf)) of expensive railway travel. The Yukon and Nunavut have [no railways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Railroads-Canada-frame.png) whatsoever and the Northwest Territories only railway terminates in Hay River. Infrastructure is a hard problem that typically gets resolved once both private corporations and government bodies realize that there are huge sums of money to be made.


There are a couple of areas in northern Canada, representing an extremely small portion of the total land mass, that I am confident will have the right ingredients to support commercial agriculture. However, I am not here to pervade my speculations. Overall, climate change presents a huge economic opportunity for northern Canada and the arctic region in general.
